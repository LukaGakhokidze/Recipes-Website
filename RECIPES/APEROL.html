    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Aperol traces its roots back to Padua, Italy. The aperitivo—an
      appetite-whetting beverage designed to be consumed before dinner—was
      created in 1919. Its bittersweet flavor, aromatic botanicals and easygoing
      alcohol content (it’s only 11% ABV) made it the perfect choice for
      pre-dinner sipping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pair Aperol with bubbly wine and sparkling water, and you’ll be
      hard-pressed to find a more refreshing and thirst-quenching cocktail. And
      because it’s low in alcohol, you can start drinking early and still make
      it to dinner.
