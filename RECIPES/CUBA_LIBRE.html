    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      As the story goes, the Cuba Libre’s origins can be traced to 1900 and to a
      U.S. Army captain who was stationed in Havana during the Spanish-American
      War. He added Coca-Cola and a little lime juice to his Bacardí rum and
      toasted his Cuban comrades by exclaiming, “Por Cuba Libre!” (“To a free
      Cuba!”). The drink, and the name, stuck.

      The Cuba Libre is more complex and beguiling than its simple formula
      suggests. It calls for rum and Coke with lime, but within those three
      ingredients lies a synergy that has pleased palates for more than a
      century. Today, it’s one of the most popular Cuban cocktails in
      existence—right near the classic Daiquiri, which was created around the
      same time.
