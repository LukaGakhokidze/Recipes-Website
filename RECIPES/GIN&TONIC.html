    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Gin & Tonic. If you can say it, you can make it. Right? Right. But also,
      not exactly. The two-ingredient cocktail requires your undivided
      attention. From glassware to garnish to style of gin and spirit proof,
      everything should be carefully considered when mixing a G&T.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is endless room for experimentation within those two ingredients.
      With hundreds of gins on the market and dozens of tonics, a good G&T is a
      mix-and-match exercise to find the combination that best suits your
      tastes. London dry gins are characterized by their juniper-forward flavor
      profile; modern-style gins often dial down the juniper and ramp up the
      citrus and florals. Some tonics are dry and straightforward, with
      prominent notes of bitter quinine. Others are sweet and syrupy. And in
      between, you’ll find tonics featuring everything from citrus and aromatics
      to herbs and spice. Then, of course, there’s the garnish. Many people
      swear by a lime. Others choose a lemon, and still others prefer a
      grapefruit slice or rosemary sprig, or a seasonal garnish such as blood
      orange and thyme.
